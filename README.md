# Auto-sklearn Fail

The code in `fail.py` runs
[auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) on a dataset for 5
minutes. The model it finds after that time is *worse* than just using a random
forest with default hyperparameters.

Find out what's going on, why auto-sklearn's performance is so bad, and how to
fix it.

## Here is what is wrong with it:

The red wine data features are all continuous, not categorical. The one-hot encoding is being done on continuous data and it is only supposed to be done on categorical data e.g. ints or strings, not floats.
